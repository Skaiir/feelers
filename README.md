# feelers

A templating solution built on top of [DMN](https://www.omg.org/spec/DMN/) FEEL. 
Like moustache / handlebars but with FEEL.

**Package includes:**
- A [lezer](https://lezer.codemirror.net/) grammar and consequently parser for the templating language
- A parseMixed language definition which brings markdown, lezer and FEEL parsing all into one
- An editor for feelers, build from [codemirror](https://codemirror.net/)
- An interpreter to fill your templates with data, powered by [feelin](https://github.com/nikku/feelin)
- A simple playground to showcase the language
